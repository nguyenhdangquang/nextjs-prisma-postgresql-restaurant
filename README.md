## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

Techstack from this project:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

> [!NOTE]
## Keys of Implementation:
    :+1: Setup Prisma ORM connect with PostgreSQL (checkout config at ./start-database.sh - Linux or OS)
    :+1: Setup Prisma built using tRPC 
    :+1: Using Nextjs for server-side rending
    :+1: Migrate table category and restaurant by categoryId is the ref of restaurant tbl (checkout seed migrate at ./prisma/seed.ts)
    :+1: Implementing APIs getRestaurants and updateFavorite (Bonus point: getCategories, searchRestaurant)
